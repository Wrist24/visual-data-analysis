Visual analysis of a database in PowerBI, querying and orchestrating data upfront using SQL and Azure Synapse Analytics

First off, I took the publicly available WideWorldImporters database provided by Microsoft. This database relates to a fictitious wholesale company with the same name, and their data on purchasing, sales, warehouse management and their employees. In SQL Server Management Studio, I was tasked with extracting valuable data pertaining to the Sales department, connected to the Warehouse in order to better understand how the company handles sales orders in the warehouse, how do they manage sub-depots and organize the products they resell, how efficient their deliveries are and in what regions of the United States do they operate the best. The extracting procedure was not very hard, as the data was very nicely organized and pretty clean, null values were there but they had significant meaning, there were no unintentionally missing values and little to no outliers. Part of my task in SQL was to also create a fact table, which I would later connect to the other dimension tables that already exist in the database in order to create a relational schema. The schema type I chose was snowflake, instead of star (due to a number of dimension tables related to one another, from which I had to take significant number of columns and a join would duplicate tuples) or constellation (there was no need for multiple fact tables, because the database only had two tables that could be seen as fact themselves and a simple join between these not only kept the records unique, but also gave significant explanation about each tuple; in addition to this, the potential complexity of two fact tables was considered, and I decided against it). In order to escape more than two dimension tables tied only to each other, I created two static views encompassing: the customers table, which I joined with the information about each customer's city and state, eliminating two extra tables; and the product table (Warehouse.StockItems) for which I took the product group information from a table called Warehouse.StockGroups which is connected to a intermediary table connecting both of the previously mentioned, with this eliminating another two tables.
